  <!--span , anchor and image tag allow us to make changes within a word for example if we want to under line only a in word "rudrakshi" then we can use
      span as <h1><span style="text-decoration:underline">a</span>rudrakshi</h1>. But droback of span tag is we cant increase or decrease the height or width
      of span tag where on other hand we can vary the size of p or h1 tags but we can change properties of a specific letter in it. To get best of both the
      world we can use display property in css {display none as well as visiblity none can make element invisible after that you can use hover to make
      it visible} -->
